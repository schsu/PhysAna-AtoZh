truth_histogram
===============

truth_histogram loops over status 1 truth electrons in the particle branch of a root file and outputs a histogram of the electrons' pt distribution. It is a simple and short program which demonstrates how to use ROOT to make histograms from data in root files. When comfortable with this code, the user of this tutorial should be able to go on to level2 and the program "inclusive_study".
